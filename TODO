TODO before 2.0.0
=================

[ ] add roadmap

[ ] http://www.osadl.org/Single-View.111+M52e8d0c2b2f.0.html

[.] ipkg with dependecies

    update: 20090614 mkl:

	ipkg are created with dependencies now, image creation still works.
	however online update is still untested, though.

[ ] rsc: port python 2.6 patches to 3.x -> mkl

[ ] rsc: add "ptxdist export_bsp <dir>", similar to
    "ptxdist export_src <dir>".

    - take care of all platforms: configs/*/platformconfig
    - images: images for all collections
    - for all optional packages: ask back if images, ipkgs etc. shall
      be bundled (with --force)

[ ] rsc: verify 'ptxdist newpacket' mechanics. Check all use cases,
    especially when creating new packages in ptxdist itself (not in the
    project). Workspace check needs more sophistication.

[ ] mol, rsc: improve user database concept. Especially for the system
    users we currently have the problem how to generate system users which
    are only necessary for certain services. Maybe some kind of
    /etc/passwd.d/* mechanism could be a solution? Discuss with team.

    Discuss UUID/GID of "rpcuser" and other important system users

[ ] jbe, rsc -> mgr: provide a "bare metal" project for Stellaris/Cortex-M3,
    to show how to use ptxdist-2 for non-Linux targets.

[ ] jbe: Shown pathes are much too long in "ptxconfig" and "platformconfig"
    while running "ptxdist menu"

[ ] jbe: We should provide a solution if someone selects "ptx" or
    "platform" while running "ptxdist menu" and these files are not new enough.
    (happens if someone wants to upgrade his ptxdist-1 based BSP). Currently
    there is only a error message, one should use "--force". Its correct, but
    is doesn't help! M$ help level!

    -> integrate --force into dialogs

[ ] jbe: most of the time thttpd does not respond to the USR1 signal.
	  - the start/stop script fails to stop this service


Unclear
-------

[ ] rsc: GDB__VERSION: shouldn't this be taken from the toolchain, in
    order to be consistent with the gdb which is provided there? Discuss
    with mkl.

[ ] rsc: multi stage BSPs: platform team releases a BSP, users use it.
    May involve 'apt-get install OSELAS.BSP-phyCORE-12'

[ ] bbu, lfu, rsc, sha: "bspfix feature"

    Usecase:

    * create BSP config with "ptxdist menuconfig"
    * "ptxdist bspfix [bspfix-name]" (creates 2nd config internally)
    * user makes changes to the software config (menuconfig) and saves
    * some kind of "diff" is made between "selected_platformconfig" and
      bspfix-config
    * if user has one or several "bspfixes" around, they are patched into
      his ptxconfig on the fly

    Aims:

    * developer: can create their own local modifications of the bsp,
      without destroying the official one
    * customer: can make his own changes ontop of our releases; changes
      are easy to move forward


Before Release
--------------

[ ] rsc: we need a "tested distros" strategy for 2.0.0, with
    pre-packaged toolchains.

[ ] rsc: run dependency hunter and fix all remaining dependency problems

[ ] update ChangeLog from git

[ ] jbe, rsc: provide demo projects for ptxdist-2.0.0, including website
    documentation, maybe even elinux.org docs.

    Release tarballs in a way that they can be installed with ptxdist, which
    means that they have to be installed into the "projects/" directory in
    the toplevel dir, to be able to clone them.

    Provide debian packages of ptxdist, ptxdist-patches, toolchains and
    demo directories.

[ ] bbu: check ptxdist first-time-usage scenario for chicken-egg problems
    e.g. if you don´t set sane defaults for PTXCONF_SETUP_PROJECTPATH,
    ptxdist won´t find its own projects.


TODO before 2.1.0
=================

[ ] rsc: 'ptxdist images' for the i586 target sometimes does not work,
    the generated image is incorrect and grub stops booting.

[ ] jbe: If someone adds a project local menu (*.in) file and uses
    'project_specific' as its SECTION name ptxdist should automatically
    generate an additional submenu "Project Specific Configuration" and
    include this menu into it. This should avoid a local "Kconfig" copy
    in each ptxdist project for such a simple addition.

[ ] lfu: some mountable devices are available after udev has started.
    hence we need an extra mount script to mount all entries in fstab
    instead out of rcS.

[ ] jbe: mplayer.compile: It seems very PXA specific now?

    i586-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc [...] -c -o vo_pxa.o vo_pxa.c
    vo_pxa.c: In function 'draw_osd':
    vo_pxa.c:964: error: unknown register name 'r5' in 'asm'
    vo_pxa.c:964: error: unknown register name 'r4' in 'asm'
    [...]
    vo_pxa.c: In function 'config':
    vo_pxa.c:964: error: unknown register name 'r5' in 'asm'
    vo_pxa.c:964: error: unknown register name 'r4' in 'asm'
    [...]
    make[2]: *** [vo_pxa.o] Error 1
    make[2]: Leaving directory `[...]/platform-i586/build-target/MPlayer-1.0rc2/libvo'

    --> menu contains pxa specific stuff. Maybe this should be modified?

    Even with disabled PXA specific options a build for x86 still fails:

    libvo/libvo.a(video_out.o):(.data+0x20): undefined reference to `video_out_x11'
    libvo/libvo.a(video_out.o):(.data+0x24): undefined reference to `video_out_xover'
    libvo/libvo.a(video_out.o):(.data+0x28): undefined reference to `video_out_pxa'
    [...] and much more

    Update 20090118 rsc: not reproducable, switched on again and we wait
    for sisyphus to explode.

[ ] jbe: all test scripts should check if their interaction with the filesystem
    where successfull. If a file copy to /tftpboot fails, it should *not* continue.

[ ] rsc: fix python 3.x

[ ] jbe: Would there be a solution to supress sysroot-* folders for target system
    (for example bare metall) that do not need a Unix filesystem?

[ ] jbe: it must be possible to force some userland components from inside the
    platformconfig. For example a platform specific kernel driver module
    needs a special component of the UDEV. Currently it does not work.
    Duplicating symbols in both config files may work, but it will be
    "BROKEN BY DESIGN".

    Update 20091017 rsc: Would it be possible to add that platform specific
    package in the platform?

[ ] rsc: configure continues, even if a test breaks. Example:
    checking lex library... sed: couldn't write 76 items to stdout: No space left on device
    grep: write error: No space left on device
    sed: couldn't write 46 items to stdout: No space left on device
    none needed
    checking whether yytext is a pointer... sed: couldn't write 29 items to stdout: No space left on device
    no
    [...anything proceeds...]

[ ] jbe: working with hd.img is very delicate. The incomplete partition
    table confuses the linux kernel, so any rewrite of the image after done
    one time fails with "no space left on device". Also fdisk fails when
    trying to repair this partition table. Only Windows can rewrite the
    partition table in this case. After this, also Linux is able to write to
    the hard disk again!  But the BIOS and Kernel on target side are
    successfull. Problem happend on SUSE-10.1 on host side and an USB to IDE
    adapter to initial write the hd.img to the harddisk.


TODO somewhen
=============

[ ] rsc: evaluate http://dolt.freedesktop.org

[ ] rsc: license management:

    - generate license dependency graph (based on objdump info?)
    - bundle GPL sources automatically

[ ] rsc: add sparse support

[ ] mol: bash configure --enable-job-control does not work when cross compiling
    posible fix in:
    https://iocaste.extern.pengutronix.de/svn/oselas/bsp/johndeere/OSELAS.BSP-JohnDeere-ComPC-trunk/rules/bash.make
    explained here:
    http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-bash%40gnu.org/msg03107.html

[ ] bbu: add more real GNU coreutils

[ ] jbe: review samba configure stage. For a non-root and cross-compile run it
    seems to omit many tests and switches of many features in the final
    application. Check if samba_cv_HAVE_IFACE_IFCONF=yes and samba_cv_HAVE_MMAP=yes
    can be used all over all architectures as defaults

[ ] bbu: add minimal documentation for internal vars (useful for
    customer makefiles) -> see manual (not quickstart)

[ ] jbe: samba fails to run with:

    sys_gethostbyname: Unknown host. eth0
    can't determine netmask for eth0
    WARNING: no network interfaces found

    Seems to be a failure with current glibc

[ ] rsc: xorg-app-xkbcomp needs xorg-lib-xkbfile, but dependency doesn't
    work

[ ] rsc: xorg-data-xkbdata needs xkbcomp on the host - otherwhise we get
    a circular dependency ...

[ ] jbe: alsa-lib creates funny pathes at the install stage

[ ] jbe: org-server fails if no xkbfile is selected

[ ] jbe: audit packages which are marked to be BROKEN

[ ] lfu: often used config files for X like xorg.conf or xinitrd shall be
    integrated into ptxdist generic files. the installation shall follow
    the scheme of other rootfs configuration files

[ ] jbe: audit all packages if they change the target CPU (with --march
    or --mtune); openssl does so

[ ] jbe: uRamdisk should be built from ipkg packages instead of root/ content!

[ ] jbe: why does fam-2.7.0 always try to run the autotools? It fails on most
    modern systems -> mark as broken. rsc: real fix: find out why and fix.

[ ] feature request: add profiling support (kernel and userspace)
    best with host visualisation

[ ] jbe: more help texts

[ ] bbu: reimplement cuckoo-test

    - files w/ wrong build-arch
    - missing libs
    - statistics
    - stripped / non stripped files

[ ] bbu: reimplement generic pre- and post-flight checks

    - dependency checks
    - cuckoo-test
    - user defined checks
    - package tests
    - in-system test -> ltp

[ ] bbu: generic logging aproach w/ single and combined logs

    - combined log for normal use

    - build-logs per package, test-suite, etc would support features like

      - "quiet build", while still providing the full error
        output of the failing target
      - helpdesk notification fetaures
      - build statistics
      - better support for GUI driven builds

[ ] bbu,rsc,mkl: brain storming session

	Discussion about the whole PTXdist build-,
	deployment- and testing-mechanics:

	- Support different target package formats
	  Rationale: - Some standardization aproaches like carrier grade linux
		       or the linux standard base make rpm or dpk packages
		       mandatory.
		     - Users asked for it
	  Which package formats would be useful ?
	  		- ipkg
			- deb
			- rpm
			- openpkg
			- plain directory tree / tar[.gz]
	  ! Depends: Check rpm and deb database footprint
	  ! Depends: Discussion about the current installation scheme

	- Support binary package distribution
	  Rationale: Most Customers don´t want to build the
	  	     base System on their own. They want a
		     well defined base system and then apply
		     some changes, add files (probably on the fly)
		     by installing binary packages.
	  ! Problem: This might break the current PTXdist philosophy
	  	     (executeable documentation)
	  ! Depends: We would need some kind of install-filter or exclude-list

	- Deployment / Testing Frontend (maybe GUI driven)
	  Rationale: needed in a binary package distribution scenario
	  	     to customize the installation from a generic
		     binary package.

	- Support precompiled customer environment
	  Rationale: This would reduce compile times for
	  	     the customer, since he would start
		     directly w/ his own application
		     w/o the need for a full ptxdist run.
	  ! Problem: Build Hierarchy is not relocateable
	  	     -> libtool problems
	  ! Problem: Make depends on timestamps
	  Possible solutions:
	  	     - create intermediate build labels / paths
		     - tweak things during installation
		       (dirty, dirty ... how do we handle updates?)
		     - Provide a "full blown" toolchain with all
		       host-tools and chroot into it
		       (dirty, dirty ... needs root privileges)
		     - Provide a "full blown" toolchain with all
		       host-tools inside a virtual machine,
		       vmware image or CoLinux
		       (dirty, slow, but runs even with Windows)
		       (nasty, since it would be some kind of closed box solution)
		       (problem: how do we handle alternative toolchains in this case?)

	- Support Partitioned Images
	  ! Problem: We don´t want to use root privileges
	  ! Problem: Generate valid Partition Tables
	  ! Problem: ipkg list has to work inside the
		     target system, so we would need
		     two or more diffenrent installation "views":
		     - The partition image generation view,
		       which
		       a) respects partition boundaries
		       b) rewrites the resulting installation
		          paths respectively.
		     - The binary target package view (i.e. ipkg)
		       which
		       a) generates apropriate pre- and post-
		          installation scripts to i.e. remount
			  the partitions read/write
		       b) creates binary packages, rooted in
		          "/" on the target.
		     - An optional "user-view", where something
		       else can happen, i.e. transfering stuff
		       to an ftp server or mounting an image
		       with root privileges or as user via fuse.

	- TODO:
		- Create Use Cases:
			- What is covered by the current design
			- What would be nice, well designed and sane
			- What does $JON_DOE_HACKER  want
			- What does $JON_DOE_HACKER _need_
			- What does $CUSTOMER  want
			- What does $CUSTOMER _need_
		- Draw the big picture :-)
		- Create Roadmap

[ ] mol: add possibility to 'ptxdist print' more than one variable in
    one make call  bbu: maybe some kind of "ptxdist env" as in env(1) ?

[ ] check if ${PTXCONF_SYSROOT_TARGET} can be written to and barf if not

[ ] add sanity checks for all user configurable variables (especially
    paths)

[ ] audit project files for CROSS_AUTOCONF

[ ] Problem: When doing things like "PKG_CONFIG_PATH=bla something",
    something does not inherit the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH.
    To achieve this properly, we need to export these variables to the
    calling shell. The same applies to lots of variables from
    Rules.make.

[ ] Write macros $(call compile) and $(call configure).

[ ] libxslt crypto support is broken

[ ] image build mechanism tries to access data and infos from already
    disabled targets! (if they where enabled before). It does so
    unless a manually delete of the remaining and (now) useless targets
    in "state/"

[ ] Tree Structure
    rsc: Find sane place for generic files from projects/generic
    ero: Make subdirectories, e.g. for x.org stuff. Might use symlinks
    to avoid changing the scripts.
    sha: push make and in files into subdirs, add patches to that dirs
    as well.

[ ] rsc: add some useful statistics at the end of build (root size, image
    size etc.).

[ ] rsc: add checksums for download

	PTXdist: fatal error ... cannot start, sorry!

[x] some_autotool_fan: shebang-line of awk-scripts should use the $AWK
    value obtained from configure.
    20090610 wsa: we hardcoded gawk where needed. configure checks now
    		  for gawk explicitly.

[x] jbe: udev seems to load kernel modules by its own. How to disable it?

    20090610 lfu: the 80-drivers rule causes such behaviour. We don't install it
    to target, since it's mostly useless for embedded targets.

[x] bbu, lfu, rsc, sha: "collections"

    Observations / Ideas:

    * "modularity" doesn't fit our needs; we don't only want to build
      the base packages plus all modules; it is more something like:
      "build minimum set", or "build minimu set + feature x"

    * "collections" are lists of packages

    Use Cases:

    * "ptxdist --collectionconfig=base go" builds the package set "base"
    * "ptxdist --collectionconfig=headless_rt go" builds the package set "headless_rt"
    * "ptxdist --collectionconfig=all go" builds all selected packages
    * "ptxdist collection <pkgset>" creates "selected_collection" and makes it
      the default for subsequent commands

    Necessary:

    * separate "targetinstall" stage from "ipkg -> root/image"
    * How to call this?
    * API? "ptxdist --pkgset=<pkgset> foobar" installs root/ and image.blub from ipkgs

[x] jbe: Would it be possible to omit the "ptxconfig" and "platformconfig" menu entries
    when run "ptxdist menu" when the "selected_ptxconfig" and "selected_platformconfig"
    are real files than links (or not exist yet)? If they are real files, the project
    is a single platform one. There is no need for this step!

    Update 2009610 mkl: done

[x] rsc: fix 'ptxdist newpacket host'; find out what mkl intended with
    this "class" mechanism and make sure it produces sane output. Check
    with mkl.

    Example: ptxdist newpacket host-existing-target:

    - asks for version number, which should be derived from existing
      target version
    - asks for URL, but we want to use the download mechanics from
      target
    - should output warning that you have to change := into = for
      corresponding target packet
      mkl: this is not true!

    jbe: discuss the templeate rules and their content with mkl to shrink them or
    to adapt them to the current ptxdist behaviour

[x] mkl/jbe: Host's environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH leaks in.
    We want a whitelist instead of the current blacklist.

    Update 20090610 mkl: done

[x] jbe: fuse can be build without libiconv. The glibc iconv() works for
    it. But its configure is so stupid, it continues to detect a libiconv
    even if disabled and link against it.  (for example if libiconv is
    already built by accident)

    Update 20090610 rsc: done

[x] jbe: host-glib can be build against the iconv() in the host's glibc.
    There is no need for a host-libiconv!

    Update 20090610 rsc: fixed

[X] jbe: Running "ptxdist menu" shows always a "u-boot-v2" entry that fails
    if called even if the platformconfig do not use u-boot-v2

[x] mkl/jbe: The 'ps' command from the procps package outputs
            "Unknown HZ value! (xx) Assume 100."
    on a recently started system. Doing it later again, this message does
    not occur again. Kernel detection failure?

    Update 20090609: (mkl) fixed

[x] jbe: dropbear's init script seems to fail to do a simple "restart". For example
    if one changes the SSH portnumber in the script and try a restart, nothing changes!

    Update 20090609 rsc: fixed

[x] jbe: the libiconv package fails to build, if a libiconv library is
    present on the host system (for example in /usr/lib). In this case it
    tries to link against this library, instead of its own. In one link
    step:
       ../srclib/libicrt.a /usr/lib/libiconv.so
    versus (if no libiconv is present on the host)
       ../srclib/libicrt.a ../lib/.libs/libiconv.so

    Update 20090609 mkl: fixed

[x] bbu: default path to generic projects seems not to work

    Update 20090603 rsc: please provide test case, seems to work here.

[-] jbe: if ipkg building crashes, PTXdist doesn't break. rsc: see
    pipeline error fixing in scripts/libptxdist.sh

    Update 20090603 rsc: we need a testcase, bug closed.

[x] bbu: Discuss the whole definition of "package". At the moment,
    most package options are scattered across two or more
    *.in or *.make files, making "drop-in replacements" nearly
    impossible.

    Update 20090603 rsc: obsoleted by package model in ptxdist 2.0.

[x] rsc: find out why iproute2 needs berkeley-db

    Update 20090603 rsc: fixed with recent iproute2 patches from jbe

[x] rsc: iproute2 -> arpd needs db-44, but the select DB_44 does not work.

    Update 20090603 rsc: seems to be fixed in trunk, close.

[x] jbe: host-intltool.prepare
      checking for XML::Parser... configure: error: XML::Parser perl module is required for intltool

    Update 20090118 rsc: add a function to 'ptxdist go' that can run
    stuff depending on ptxconfig; I don't want to add a ptxdist dependency
    to XML::Parser and perl, just for glade. Something that runs on 'ptxdist
    go' or 'ptxdist <some_stage>' (FIXME which one?) and can output something
    like "error: need perl and XML::Parser to build glade".

    Update 2009-01-20:  jbe: add a test for perl XML::Parser into these
			makefiles and fail gracefully with a nice error
			message. So this test runs on demand only.

[x] jbe: "ptxdist platformconfig" moans:
    error: The configfile version and ptxdist version do not match:
        configfile version:
        ptxdist version:    1.99.svn
    Users current focus is on "selected_platformconfig". But ptxdist
    moans about an empty 'selected_ptxconfig' here!

    Instead it should:
    - output the correct filename which is causing the problem here
    - silently does its job, because the platformconfig is all right here
    - should output this message, when running a "ptxdist menuconfig"

[x] Whenever a new packet dependency is added to the menus and one does not
    update the used ptxconfig file, the next build will only detect the
    "<packet_name>.install" dependency and fail due to the fact the
    "<packet_name>.[get|extract|prepare|compile]" are still missing. When
    ptxdist is able to detect the dependency to "<packet_name>.install", it
    should also add the other targets (get|extract|prepare|compile) from inside
    the <packet_name> silently. The current error is confusing, because it
    occures even the user didn't change anything in his/her project.

[x] jbe: Would it be possible to delete a directory defined by PTXCONF_SYSROOT_TARGET
    in the form "${PTXDIST_WORKSPACE}/local/${PTXCONF_ARCH_STRING}"
    Currently the "local" part still exists when running "ptxdist clean".
    This is for ptxdist-1 backward compatibility.

    Update 20090126:	the correct is path is:

    Update 2007-01-24:	rsc: rejected. Ant is only needed by tools which
			use Java, and we don't want a prerequisite to
			java in PTXdist. Maybe add some loud warning if
			packets are built which use java, such as jvisu.
    Update 2009-01-20:  jbe: add a test for 'ant' into jvisu's makefile and
			fail gracefully with a nice error message. So this test
			runs on demand only.

    Update 2009-01-26:	done, no tests in the configure script for now.

[x] migrate libc from ptxconfig to platform

[x] rsc: config dependency dropper doesn't work yet; it assumes that all
    labels correspond to their package names, but that's not true for
    busybox, so the dropping doesn't work for bb. The right solution would be
    to change PTXCONF_BB_ to PTXCONF_BUSYBOX__, but that would break all
    migrations of old projects. Can only be done with a proper migration
    script.

[x] Subject: Re: [ptxdist-commit] ptxdist r9228 - in trunks/ptxdist-trunk/patches:
    libffi-3.0.7 libffi-3.0.7/generic

    I am not sure this is the correct fix. The problem seems that ptxdist
    uses ac_cv_sizeof_long_double with a value of 8, and that is where the
    problem is, because that should be 12 on x86 and 16 on x86_64. That
    error results in double and long double to have the same size and
    configure to conclude there is no long double. And since that is never
    true on x86 with gcc, there was no need for the ifdef with
    HAVE_LONGDOUBLE in the x86 case.

    - Erwin

    rsc: add proper definitions according to platform definition
    (PTXCONF_SIZEOF_LONG_DOUBLE)

[x] rsc: fix install_copy without source+destination; it worked before
    with destination-only, but there was some problem. Ask mkl.

    Update 20081228: rsc: seems like it works in the current trunk.

[x] rsc: autogenerated menues with overwriting.

[x] jbe: Getting the value of an internal ptxdist variable returns always 1 as
    its exit code ("ptxdist print ROOTDIR" returns with the correct value on stdout
    but with exit code = 1)

    Update 20081227: rsc: fixed, but now 'ptxdist print' is pretty slow.

[x] when the drop command is used without a stage, complain about that

[x] rsc: toolchain selection doesn't work if gcc revision is empty=nocheck

[x] rsc: platformconfig: check what about PTXCONF_IMAGE_IPKG_ARCH; it
    should go to the platformconfig code.

    arm -> oabi
    armel -> eabi little endian
    armeb -> eabi big endian

    This would make our packages compatible with maemo + debian

    [x] 20081107 mkl: we use not PTXDIST_IPKG_ARCH_STRING which is generated in
		      scripts/lib/ptxd_make_install.sh

[x] rsc: we don't seem to have a target option for the endianess!

[x] rsc: SuSE has an old stat version which doesn't support --printf;

[x] jbe: if the kernel.extract stage fails, ptxdist returns with exit code 0
    Can be replicated by deleting the configures series file for the patch
    stack in use.

[x] BBU: Implement scheme for alternative download-URLs as
    fallback (e.g. mirrors)

[x] add menu entry for user local config files in /etc

[x] mol: ptxdist commands behave differently for arguments which exceed
    the "current" command; some continue parsing and some exit.

	* Gentoo
	* Debian

[x] bbu: audit *.in and *.make files, broken install definitions everywhere [tm]
	 (mostly c&p errors, probably)

[x] repair make makro 'install'; there are sometimes three """.
    See procps.install for reference.

[x] jbe: reduce directory count on top level, combine build-* and
    local-* into a shared subdir rsc: we've agreed on this variant:

    	build-host/
	build-target/
	build-cross/
	local/
	local-target/
	local-cross/

[x] jbe: cleanup rules/other/Toplevel.make

[x] jbe: remove ptxdist's documentation from the installation.
	 It's now useless and outdated as a better alternative
	 is present with the application notes

[x] jbe: hd images must be built from ipkgs to support the ipkg tool
	 on the target

[x] if a packet is not selected, it's dependencies are not generated. If
    you kick a stage then, the dependend stages are not executed.
    Solution: generate the stages as well, so we get an error in that
    case.

[x] RSC:is "select GLIBC_DEBUG" in gdb.in necessary??

[x] jbe: Switching from generating hd image to jffs2 image _rebuilds_
	 the the whole project!

	 Known Problem: the virtual-cross-tools depends on host-mtd-utils,
	 which is selected by JFFS2. this must depend on images somewhere.
	 mkl knows how to fix it...

[x] jbe: current trunk complains
	glib.make:40: warning: overriding commands for target `/home/all_src/glib-2.8.6.tar.bz2'
	host-glib.make:38: warning: ignoring old commands for target `/home/all_src/glib-2.8.6.tar.bz2'

[x] jbe: if the "ptxdist toolchain" step was omited, ptxdist complains
	 about toolchain vendor instead of missing toolchain

[x] jbe: if ptxdist was called with wrong parameters (and complains about it) it
	 should return also an error return code (so something like
	 "ptxdist clen kernel && ptxdist go" fails)

[x] jbe: ipkg does not work on the target anymore. Cannot install anything.

[x] jbe: suppress cross toolchain and toolchain vendor check while --native build

[x] rsc: put export LANG=C somewhere into PTXdist, to make compiler
         output more readable

[x] jbe: "ptxdist help" does not output the new option "platformconfig"


[x] jbe: if the ptx dialog will be called from within the menu dialog the loop
    should stop, if calling the ptx dialog resturns with an error. In one case
    one of the *.in files was missed and the error message can't be read

[x] jbe: udev. Generic startscript complains about a missing udev-adm

[x] jbe: fakeroot seems to have problems to run in a 64 bit environment. Not
	 at the image creation stage, only at the "install" stage

	 - fakeroot fails on all glibc 2.5 based systems

[x] jbe: rules file for zlib is broken since ptxdist-0.10.6!
	 What the hell means libz.so.0.0.0???? In ptxdist-0.10.5 it was libz.so.1.2.3!

[x] jbe: transfer ipkg's runtime configuration to the ipkg packet itself
	-> its not rootfs

[x] jbe: uboot-1.2.0's build system is not multi processor save
	-> supress -j option

[x] pureftp's configure runs twice and needs host's autotools!

[x] audit the logfile of AllYesArm for autotool calls

    Update 2007-01-24:	rsc: the solution is simple: just add
    			AM_MAINTAINER_MODE to the configure.in/ac if the
			autotools are re-run. This avoids that the
			maintainer dependencies are put into the packet.

   [x] util-linux: re-calls automake during compile;
   [x] libxslt: re-calls automake during compile
   [x] pure-ftpd: re-calls automake during compile

[x] jbe: all local sources (file://) are still do a touch into the package directory.
    (into "Source Directory"). If this file gets deleted, ptxdist builds the whole
    package again (and recreate the file in the Source Directory).

    Update 2007-01-24:	fixed; order of PACKET-empty check in extract
    			was changed.

[x] jbe: Chrony fails to compile

    Update 2007-01-25:	jbe: better fix; force chrony to use the wide ncurses lib
			if present, else the non wide one
    Update 2007-01-19:	rsc: fixed; ncurses didn't install the
			non-widechar variants of the libraries.

[x] jbe: starting with a new and empty project should provide the user with
    a generic (and default) ptxconfig instead of an error message.
    But it should not do it automatically! It should ask before doing it!
    Otherwise we will end up with many ptxconfig files in many directories...

    Update 2007-01-19:	rsc: it's not so easy as "touch ptxconfig &&
			ptxdist oldconfig". Error message is improved
			the preferred way to start a new project is
			cloning.

[x] jbe: host-mknbi fails to build

    Update 2007-01-19:	rsc: doesn't work, hasn't for ages, deleted

[x] jbe: liboldX fails to build the ipkg but the build continues!

    Update 2007-01-19:	rsc: fixed

[x] unbreak host-zlib; it is necessary for host-umkimage if there is no
    zlib devel packet installed on the host.

[x] omitting glibc installation should be possible, first hack attempt
    done

    Update 2007-01-12:	No idea what the reason was; we don't have a
    			concept for anything else than shared libs and
			glibc.

[x] rsc: fakeroot-the-hosttool seems not to be found - reported by wrap. It
    looks to me as if $(PTXDIST_WORKSPACE)/local/bin has to be included
    into the path somehow. Ask mkl.

[x] Our current host tools use their target counterparts for getting the
    sources; if the target counterpart is not selected, the dependencies
    are not created correctly! Test: switch off ipkg but activate
    host-ipkg.

[x] audit 'get' stage

[x] Menu Structure
    JBE: Use menuconfig instead of menu + configs whereever possible.
    It looks nicer in "menuconfig" and its much better supported when using
    "xconfig"

[x] ptxdist should reject working as ROOT

[x] add prerequisite checks to configure script; find out which
    prerequisites we really need.

[x] Toolchain selection
    JBE:  add an identifier to a (central) toolchain (in "make setup").
    It should be possible to use more than one toolchain in a local
    ptxdist folder (for different targets/projects). So the idetifier
    selects the right toolchain for this project. This identifier
    simplifies the toolchain selection. There could be a central
    folder in the system with all informations (and identifiers)
    about any available toolchain installed on this system.
	 --> done: "ptxdist toolchain path" per project

[x] discuss UID of user "nobody" and GID of "nogroup"

[x] jbe: ptxdist images fails for jffs2 fileimage creation
	it seems local-host/sbin is not in the PATH

[x] jbe: procps.install stage fails with:

	make: Ungültige Option -- y
	make: Ungültige Option -- L
	make: Ungültige Option -- /
	make: Ungültige Option -- L
	make: Ungültige Option -- /

	Seems the install macro emits: make [...] CFLAGS=""" LDFLAGS=""" [...]

[x] jbe: udev needs rules to control permissions on device nodes; jbe
    currently writes docs for this.

[x] jbe/rsc: /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/nsswitch.conf:
    Find a solution to generate DNS configuration files from other sources
    like boardsetup (I have no clue what this means).
    "Then either have no resolv.conf at all (use /etc/hosts only), or generate
    resolv.conf from 'ptxdist boardsetup' information and generate a
    sane nsswitch.conf."

[x] rsc: check if we can update mtd-utils from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1; mkl has
    already prepared the patches; find out why the revision number was
    not bumped. mkl: 1.0.1 needs acl, so we stay with 1.0.0

[x] ssh: server start scripts are missing

[x] ssh: key gen mechanics needed

[x] dbus needs user messagebus -> /etc/passwd; jbe: needs other user,
    non-root; add this user to /etc/passwd. Debian has a user called
    "messagebus", we should do it the same way. Define a sane UID (ask
    jbe)

[x] rsc: find out why mkl added this new dependency mechanism which
    searches for ${${LABEL}_DIR}/.ptx-extract.

[x] rsc: merge mkl's host/cross/target-pkg-config fixes. We need this to
    have a proper x.org and host-dbus.

[x] jbe: make DHCP client useful on the target. Currently only the binary
    will be built and copied, but does not work on the target

[x] jbe: update DHCP tp 3.0.5 or correct path to 3.0.4

[x] jbe: creating links into non existent directories fails, but does
    not break the build!

    Update 2007-01-12:	rsc/mkl: the install_link macro has mkdir -p
			calls in all relevant places; should not
			happen -> jbe: retest.

TODO.rsc

[ ] connman:

	[ ] add configure switch for glib detection
