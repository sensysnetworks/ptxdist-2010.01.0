	  A small caching DNS proxy and DHCP server.

 	  Dnsmasq is lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder
	  and DHCP server. It is designed to provide DNS and,
	  optionally, DHCP, to a small network. It can serve the
	  names of local machines which are not in the global DNS.
	  The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows
	  machines with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS
	  with names configured either in each host or in a central
	  configuration file. Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic
 	  DHCP leases and BOOTP for network booting of diskless machines.
	  Note: In order to make dnsmasq work as DHCP, you have to enable
	  the following kernel features: FIXME

if DNSMASQ

comment "build options   ---"

config DNSMASQ_DBUS
	bool
	prompt "include DBUS support [BROKEN]"
	depends on BROKEN
	help
	  This enables DBUS support in dnsmasq. This is not only a build
	  option. You also have to enable it at runtime. FIXME: Show how,
	  see DBUS document in dnsmasq packet

config DNSMASQ_TFTP
	bool
	prompt "include TFTP"
	help
	  This includes TFTP services into dnsmasq

config DNSMASQ_IPV6
	bool
	prompt "enable IPv6"

		  Install a inetd rule for dnsmasq. This option adds the following line
		  to /etc/inetd.conf.d/dnsmasq:

		  domain stream tcp nowait root /sbin/dnsmasq domain

		  Note: You must enable one of the two possible inet daemons:
		  There is one embedded in busybox and one in packet inetutils.
		  Note: If you want to use dnsmasq's DHCP feature, you can't
		  run it from inetd. In this case you need the standalone
		  startscript!

	config DNSMASQ_STARTSCRIPT
		bool
		prompt "standalone"
		help
		  This installs dnsmasq startup script /etc/init.d/dnsmasq.
		  With this script the dnsmasq server will be started at system
		  startup and waits for any kind of DHCP or DNS requests.
