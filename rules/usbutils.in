	  Linux USB utilities

	  This package contains the lsusb utility for inspecting the
	  devices connected to the USB bus. It shows a graphical
	  representation of the devices that are currently plugged
	  in, showing the topology of the USB bus. It also displays
	  information on each individual device on the bus.

	  More information can be found at the Linux USB web site
	  http://www.linux-usb.org/usbutils

	  lsusb - list the devices connected to a host

	  Note: To use lsusb don't forget to enable kernel's usb
	  filesystem and to mount it at runtime at /proc/bus/usb. An
	  entry like:

	  "usbfs /proc/bus/usb usbfs devgid=14,devmode=0660 0 0"

	  in the /etc/fstab does the job.
