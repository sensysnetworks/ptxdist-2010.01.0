	  libpciaccess contains low level access functions to be used by
	  the xorg servers and video drivers.

	help
	  Build a static only version of this library. This makes sense if only
	  one program will use this library on the target and it makes more
	  sense if a CPU with low register count (like x86) is in use.

config LIBPCIACCESS_MTRR
	bool
	prompt "MTRR support"
	help
	  You should carefully check if your x86 target CPU supports MTRRs,
	  and if so enable this menuentry.
	  BTW: MTRR stands for "memory type range registers" and its used to
	  optimize accesses to various memory types, like main memory
	  or memory accessible via busses like video memory on PCI cards.
