	  The GNU Debugger

	  GDB is a source-level debugger, capable of breaking programs
	  at any specific line, displaying variable values, and
	  determining where errors occurred. Currently, it works for
	  C, C++, Fortran, Modula 2 and Java programs. A must-have for
	  any serious programmer.

	  	  Use termcap as terminal library.

		  Termcap is a library of C functions that
		  enable programs to send control strings
		  to terminals in a way independent of the
		  terminal type.

		bool "ncurses"
		help
	  	  Use ncurses as terminal library.

		  The ncurses (new curses) library is a free
		  software emulation of curses. It uses terminfo
		  format, supports pads and color and multiple
		  highlights and forms charcters and function-key
		  mapping.
