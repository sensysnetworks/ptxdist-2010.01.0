	  DirectFB is a thin library that provides hardware
	  graphics acceleration, input device handling and
	  abstraction, integrated windowing system with support
	  for translucent windows and multiple display layers,
	  not only on top of the Linux Framebuffer Device.
	  It is a complete hardware abstraction layer with
	  software fallbacks for every graphics operation that
	  is not supported by the underlying hardware. DirectFB
	  adds graphical power to embedded systems and sets a
	  new standard for graphics under Linux.
