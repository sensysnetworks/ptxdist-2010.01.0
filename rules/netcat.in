	  This is the GNU Flavour of the "netcat" utility.

	  Netcat is a simple Unix utility which reads and writes
	  data across network connections using TCP or UDP protocol.
	  It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be
	  used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts.
	  At the same time it is a feature-rich network debugging and
	  exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of
 	  connection you would need and has several interesting built-in
	  capabilities.

	  It provides access to the following main features:

    	  * Outbound and inbound connections, TCP or UDP,
	    to or from any ports.
	  * Featured tunneling mode which allows also special
	    tunneling such as UDP to TCP, with the possibility
	    of specifying all network parameters (source port/interface,
	    listening port/interface, and the remote host allowed to
	    connect to the tunnel.
    	  * Built-in port-scanning capabilities, with randomizer.
    	  * Advanced usage options, such as buffered send-mode
	    (one line every N seconds), and hexdump (to stderr or
	    to a specified file) of trasmitted and received data.
    	  * Optional RFC854 telnet codes parser and responder.
