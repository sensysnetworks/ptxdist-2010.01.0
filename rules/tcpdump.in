	  Tcpdump  prints out the headers of packets on a network interface
	  that match the boolean expression.  It can also be run with
	  the -w flag, which causes it to save the packet data to a file
	  for later analysis, and/or with the -r flag, which causes it to
	  read from a saved packet file rather than to read  packets from
	  a network interface.  In all cases, only packets that match
	  expression will be processed by tcpdump.

config TCPDUMP_ENABLE_CRYPTO
	bool
	prompt "enable crypto support"
	depends on BROKEN
	help
	  Select this, if you don't need support for
	  encryption (e.g. IPsec ESP packets)

config TCPDUMP_SMB
	bool
	prompt "enable possibly-buggy SMB printer"
	default y
	help
	  Notes from configure, when this entry is checked:
	   The SMB printer may have exploitable buffer overflows!!!

config TCPDUMP_IPV6
	bool
	select LIBPCAP_IPV6
	prompt "enable ipv6 (with ipv4) support"
	help
	  Enable this if you require ipv6 support. This also requires ipv6
	  support in libpcap (already done if you check this entry)
