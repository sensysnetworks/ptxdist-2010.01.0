	  secure shell client/server, an rlogin/rsh/rcp replacement

	  ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote
	  machine and for executing commands on a remote machine. It
	  provides secure encrypted communications between two
	  untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections
	  and arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the
	  secure channel. It is intended as a replacement for rlogin,
	  rsh and rcp, and can be used to provide applications with a
	  secure communication channel.
