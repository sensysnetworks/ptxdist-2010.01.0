	  Flash is an attempt to address the security
	  problems associated with giving local unix
	  users full shell access. It is a (hopefully)
	  secure shell which will only execute administrator
	  defined programs, while also being very user
	  friendly. Flash is fully windowed (using an
	  ncurses interface).
