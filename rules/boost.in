	  Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.  The
	  project emphasizes libraries that work well with the C++ Standard
	  Library.  Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable
	  across a broad spectrum of applications. The Boost license encourages
	  both commercial and non-commercial use.

	  The boost team aims to establish "existing practice" and provide
	  reference implementations so that Boost libraries are suitable for
	  eventual standardization. Ten Boost libraries are already included in
	  the C++ Standards Committee's Library Technical Report ( TR1) as a step
	  toward becoming part of a future C++ Standard. More Boost libraries are
	  proposed for the upcoming TR2.
