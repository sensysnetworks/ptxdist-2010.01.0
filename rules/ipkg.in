		  This path is put into the /etc/ipkg.conf file and specifies
		  where to find an IPKG packet feed.

		  Note: Keep the "src" in front of the URL, its required if the
		  URL should be used.

		  If you don't want to use this feature, keep the whole entry empty.

		  Important: To make ipkg work at runtime, you must install this
		  configuration file. Without it you can't install new packages.
